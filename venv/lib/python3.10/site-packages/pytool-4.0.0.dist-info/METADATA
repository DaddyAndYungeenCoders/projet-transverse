# Pytool Package

`pytool` is a collection of often used
helper methods and classes that make life easier or fill in gaps in the
Python Standard Library.

Pytool is compatible with and tested against Python 3.8 and higher. End of life Python versions are not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Pytool 4.x is a major release that is not backwards compatible with earlier
> versions. It now requires Python 3.8 or higher, and adds Python 3 type
> annotations among other improvements. New features will only be added to the
> 4.x release line.

Pytool's source is hosted on Github: <https://github.com/shakefu/pytool>
